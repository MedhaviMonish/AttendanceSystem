# AttendanceSystem
Attendance System using face detection of OpenCV and facial recognition with Machine learning.

The Dataset/0 is used to train the model to recognize images that are not face, because OpenCV sometimes 
detect some images that are not of face.

Each folder in Dataset will contain images of a particular person so that folder name can be sed as class label for that person.

After recording all faces you can click on train so that the model learns how to recognize the given faces in the dataset
